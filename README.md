## Features:

1. Randomly generated characters from the Harry Potter API.
2. Score and high score tracking.
3. Advanced gamemode with randomised character card numbers and positions.
4. Simple and clean UI.

## What I used/learned:

- React: useEffect, useState.
- Using effects to fetch data from an API, and running functions when a state changes.

### What I did well:

- I think the game is quite fun and challenging, and the UI is clean and simple.
- All API interactions are handled using useEffect, and no data is stored in the app.

### Problems I faced:

1. I had to use a different API than the one I wanted to use, as the original API was not working properly.
2. I had some other responsibilities to take care of, so I had to take a break from the project for a while, starting over led to a lot of refactoring.
